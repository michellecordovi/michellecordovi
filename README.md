# 👋 Hi, I'm Michelle! (she/her)

💡 I am a freelance frontend web developer and designer. I currently run <a href="marigoldwebstudio.com">Marigold Web Studio</a>, a small business that specializes in Frontend Web Development and Squarespace Web Design services to service-based small businesses. I'm currently seeking to transition into full-time, full-stack software engineering. 
<br>

💻 As a business owner and a former healthcare worker, I have years of experience working directly with clients, managing small-scale web development projects, and problem solving in fast-paced environments.
<br>

🧠 I've got a passion for learning and growth
<br>

✨ In my free time, I love: Running, hiking, rock climbing, watercoloring, chess, sudoku, and playing with my dogs
<br>
